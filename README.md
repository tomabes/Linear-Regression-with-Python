# Linear-Regression-with-Python
In this Coursera project, I implemented Linear Regression using Python and Numpy. I built a model from scratch, trained it using gradient descent, and optimized the parameters. This project helped me understand how linear regression works, including the math behind optimization and the training process for predictive modeling
